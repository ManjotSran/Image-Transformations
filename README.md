# Histogram and Intensity Transformations
## Objectives
Pixel Transforms are operations you perform one pixel at a time. In this lab, you will start by creating histograms. Histograms display the intensity of the image and can be used to optimize image characteristics. You will then apply Intensity Transformations, making objects easier to see by improving image contrast and brightness. In the last portion of the lab, you will use thresholding to segment objects from images.
